The COVID-19 dashboard provides a regularly updated status on COVID-19 at UCSC. The UCSC testing data in the dashboard will be updated on those days when complete testing data is available for a 24-hour period during which asymptomatic testing was conducted. This data will help inform decisions about on-campus operations and activities.

The data includes the daily total number of tests run through the UCSC Molecular Diagnostic Lab and the daily total of new cases. The data includes a seven-day average positivity rate for all tests performed through the campus testing program.

UCSC cautions against drawing broad conclusions from the data about the prevalence of COVID-19 on campus, particularly since the student data set includes symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and only data collected through the campus testing program.
