## Employee Training
All employees who will be working onsite must complete the [COVID-19 Workplace Safety training](https://uc.sumtotal.host/core/pillarRedirect?relyingParty=LM&url=app%2Fmanagement%2FLMS_ActDetails.aspx%3FActivityId%3D403232%26UserMode%3D0). The module covers information about how to limit the spread of COVID-19, how to screen for symptoms, and what to do if an employee has symptoms of COVID-19.
