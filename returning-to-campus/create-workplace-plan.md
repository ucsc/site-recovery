### Current Status of Campus Operations

UC Santa Cruz remains in Phase 3 of operational resumption. All operations that can be done remotely should continue to do so. However, as the need to resume certain functions, particularly those needed in preparation for fall quarter, this document provides a summary of the process used to initiate a request for resumption and then complete the needed operational review.

### Department/Unit Instructions

Department return-to-on site operations were developed to assist units in developing a plan for how departments slowly and deliberately move currently-remote operations back to on campus/on-site operations over the coming months ahead.

The process is based on two key principles:

* **Maintaining the safety and health of our community by focusing first on those functions that must be on-site to serve the community.** All operations will be required to have a review of their function prior to moving forward with resumption of on-site operations.
* **Ensuring compliance with federal, state and local guidance.** In addition to the State of Californiaâ€™s Resilience Roadmap, we have guidance from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Cal OSHA and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

We will continue to add to this process as further state and federal guidance is received but we want to enable you to start developing initial plans now. The Work Site Plan is built as both guidance and a template.

**Step 1:** Principal Officers will make determinations about what functions will be submitted for review as part of the return to on-site operations.

Once a principal officer determines that a function should go through the review process, then a request is submitted using the [Request to Engage in On-site Work Resumption Review](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1efH_SosQgn4KPrdt8VNpGONK3URQ3-wpG7qXoHzH_Kc/viewform?ts=5efb86de&edit_requested=true).


_Pending approval to return_

**Step 2:** Units approved to move forward will complete a [worksite plan](/assets/images/worksite-plan.pdf) and complete mitigations. 

_Pending approval of worksite plan_

**Step 3:** If work site plans are approved, then the unit can commence the return of employees and resume on-site operations.

**Step 4:** There will be a post-implementation review, and compliance with work site plans will be monitored. Questions about the process can be sent to [worksite@ucsc.edu](mailto:worksite@ucsc.edu).
