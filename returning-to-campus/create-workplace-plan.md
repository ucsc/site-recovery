Every UC Santa Cruz building is unique, so each department must create a worksite plan that meets current public health guidelines before employees who’ve been working remotely may gradually return to campus — when appropriate and necessary. The COVID-19 Worksite Plan outlines criteria to asses for building compliance to COVID-19 mandates, guidelines, or safety readiness. Following initial building assessment and identification of required mitigations, facilities will not be re-opened for operations until all mitigations are met and a statement of attestation is executed.
