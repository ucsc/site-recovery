### Current Status of Campus Operations
UC Santa Cruz remains in Phase 3 of operational resumption. At this point in time, all campus operations that can operate remotely will remain remote. However, as the need arises to resume certain on-site functions, particularly those needed in preparation for fall quarter, this page provides a summary of the process used to review and approve requests.

### Process overview

The process for reviewing and approving the return to on-site operations assists departments in developing a plan for slowly and deliberately moving currently-remote operations back on-campus/on-site.
The process is based on two key principles:

* **Maintaining the health and wellness of our community by focusing first on those functions that must be on-site to serve the community.** All operations will be required to have a review of their function prior to moving forward with resumption of on-site operations.
* **Ensuring compliance with federal, state and local guidance.** In addition to the State of Californiaâ€™s Resilience Roadmap, we must adhere to guidance from a variety of entities, including but not limited to: California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Cal OSHA, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

We will continue to add to this process as further state and federal guidance is received, but the steps outlined below provide a general overview. 

**Step 1:** Principal Officers will make determinations about what functions will be submitted for review as part of the return to on-site operations.
Once a principal officer determines that a function should go through the review process, then a request is submitted using the [Request to Engage in On-site Work Resumption Review](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1efH_SosQgn4KPrdt8VNpGONK3URQ3-wpG7qXoHzH_Kc/viewform?ts=5efb86de&edit_requested=true).

*Pending approval to return* 

**Step 2:** Units approved to move forward will complete a [worksite plan](https://recovery.ucsc.edu/assets/images/worksite-plan.pdf) and complete mitigations. The worksite plan template is intended to be both a guide and plan.

*Pending approval of worksite plan*

**Step 3:** If worksite plans are approved, then the unit can commence the return of employees and resume on-site operations.

**Step 4:** There will be a post-implementation review, and compliance with worksite plans will be monitored.
