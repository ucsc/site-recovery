COVID-19 requires all of us to be even more attentive to our health, regularly checking for symptoms associated with the virus.

Employees who work on-site at a UCSC property must complete a daily COVID-19 symptom check questionnaire prior to reporting for work. Once [registered](https://ucsantacruz.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_007UYZZnkIAUmkR), employees will receive a daily symptom questionnaire each morning at 3 a.m. Employees must complete this questionnaire at home, before coming to work. The questionnaire is brief and should take less than four minutes to complete.

Questionnaire results will be used for limited purposes, e.g. only be used for COVID-19 exposure contact tracing notification or for workers’ compensation claims. Questionnaire responses will not be maintained in employee personnel files. Responses will be stored in a secure, HIPAA compliant application and purged after 90 days.
