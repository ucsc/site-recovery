More than ever, it’s important to take care of our own health and do our part to reduce the spread of COVID-19. 

There are a few basic habits we should all adopt: wearing face coverings, practicing physical distancing, washing our hands regularly, and sanitizing shared equipment. 

### Wear a Face Covering
Californians and Banana Slugs must wear face coverings in common and public indoor spaces and outdoors when distancing is not possible. [Read more](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf) about the guidance and limited exceptions. 

Cloth face coverings serve to keep each of us from sharing respiratory “droplets” with those around us. Given the community spread of COVID-19 throughout Santa Cruz county and the Bay Area, some people may have been infected but will not have symptoms for several days, while others may be carriers of the virus but never show symptoms. Current information indicates that these people can unintentionally infect others around them.

Reusable cloth face coverings can be made from readily available items such as scarves, bandanas, or neck gaiters, as well as fitted masks that can be made at home or obtained online.

UCSC employees and students are welcome to use their own cloth face coverings. In addition, the campus is coordinating with campus partners to procure reusable cloth face coverings for essential staff working on campus and students living in on-campus housing who are unable to provide their own. Please note, these will be non-medical grade face coverings.  Priority will be given to essential staff working on campus in close quarters and in confined indoor spaces, including dining services, housing staff, and custodial services.

### Social Distancing Protocol
UCSC is taking the following measures to ensure the health of faculty, staff, students, patients and their families:

* Everyone who can carry out their work duties from home has been instructed to do so.
* Employees shall not come to work if they are sick. Do not enter UCSC facilities if you are sick. 
* UCSC requires all faculty, staff, and students to maintain 6 feet of distance when moving about on campus. Abstain from physical contact, including shaking hands.
* UCSC requires all faculty, staff, and students to observe good hygiene and to cough or sneeze into their elbows.
* All UCSC employees who can carry out their work duties from home have been encouraged to speak to their supervisor about working remotely.
* Where possible, desks or individual workstations should be separated by at least six feet.
* Increase the frequency of disinfecting break rooms, bathrooms, common areas and high-contact surfaces.
* Soap and water are available to all employees and the public at all restrooms. 
* Hand sanitizer effective against COVID-19 is available at certain locations presenting a greater likelihood of contact with the public.
* UCSC affiliates should wear a face cover when social distancing cannot be achieved.
* All non-essential events and gatherings have been cancelled or postponed. 
* UCSC has closed areas that are used for gatherings such as libraries, gyms, and events centers, among other facilities.
* UCSC requires that all classes and meetings take place remotely, where possible.
* UCSC has stopped offering self-service food stations such as salad bars and buffets.
* At high-traffic food facilities, floor markings have been applied to indicate six feet of separation for those in line, and customers are encouraged to use the markings to maintain distance.
* UCSC encourages the use of contactless payment systems, where possible.
