To support the public health of our community, the in-person return of our workforce and our students to onsite operations at all UC Santa Cruz locations will be [conducted in a phased manner](https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/06/final-campus-operational-resumption-phases.pdf). The guiding emphasis of decisions will be on public health and reducing COVID-19 spread, while supporting our academic mission.

Though Santa Cruz County has been approved to move to Stage 2 of the [California Resilience Roadmap to Recovery](https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/), county orders currently allow us to operate only those activities that facilitate remote learning or performing essential functions. Higher education is listed by the state as one of the sectors still not allowed to fully operate in-person. The majority of operations continue to be remote. Essential functions allowed to take place on-site must continue to be undertaken in compliance with existing orders from the state and county. We are closely monitoring and assessing these orders as they are updated.

There are [five general phases](https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/06/final-campus-operational-resumption-phases.pdf) to campus COVID-19 operating status. They align with the stages of the California Resilience Roadmap. The specifics and timing of the campus phases are subject to change as adjustments are made at the county and state level. As Santa Cruz County now moves into Stage 2 of the state roadmap, UCSC is moving into Phase 3 of our campus plan for resuming in-person operations. At this point, all activities that can be carried out remotely will continue to do so. 

Increases in county or regional COVID-19 positive cases may require regional Public Health Departments (County of Santa Cruz, Santa Clara County, etc.) to issue new orders that may result in the campus adjusting plans and reverting to prior phases.
