Even though we may be physically apart, Slugs are all in this together and students have a number of support and engagement services available to ensure their success. Student Health Services, Counseling and Psychological Services, Basic Needs support, Academic Advising, Learning Support Services, and CARE are open and providing services remotely. 

As COVID-19 restrictions are eased, more campus resources are being offered in person. Don’t forget that [green badges](https://healthcenter.ucsc.edu/services/covid-19/covid19-students.html) are required for students to access these in-person resources:

* The University Library is offering currently registered students who live on or off campus [reservable individual quiet study spaces](https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/02/reserve-study-space.html) with access to power/wifi in the Science & Engineering Library.
* The [McHenry Library](https://library.ucsc.edu/) building remains closed, though many [library services](https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/remote-access) are still available, and library employees are working remotely to help students.
* The pool is open to students for lap swimming and the East Tennis Courts are available for tennis on a [reservation system](https://campusrec.ucsc.edu/Program/GetProducts?classification=26e7654b-b3c6-45de-ac5e-967a7ade45c3). 
* The outdoor jogging path around the Upper East Field, the Disc Golf Course, and the West Tennis Courts are currently available for drop-in use.
