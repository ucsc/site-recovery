Even though we may be physically apart, Slugs are all in this together and students have a number of support and engagement services available to ensure their success. Student Health Services, Counseling and Psychological Services, Basic Needs support, Academic Advising, Learning Support Services, and CARE are open and providing services remotely. 

Beginning Feb. 16, 2021, the University Library will offer currently registered students who live on or off campus [reservable individual quiet study spaces](https://news.ucsc.edu/2021/02/reserve-study-space.html) with access to power/wifi in the Science & Engineering Library.

The [McHenry Library](https://library.ucsc.edu/) building remains closed, though many [library services](https://guides.library.ucsc.edu/remote-access) are still available, and library employees are working remotely to help students.

The [Keep Learning site](https://keeplearning.ucsc.edu) provides resources and support for students who are learning remotely, and Information Technology Services offers [useful resources](https://its.ucsc.edu/covid-19/students-remotely.html) to help students learn and study remotely and runs a [loaner laptop program](https://its.ucsc.edu/covid-19/students-remotely.html#loaner).

A full list of services and operating hours is [available online](/support-for-students/campus-services). There are a variety of offices available to provide [support and help to students](/support-for-students/resources).
